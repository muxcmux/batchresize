{"name":"Batchresize","tagline":"A small image batch resizing tool for processing images before sharing online","body":"## Batchresize - a small batch resizing utility\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Resizes all .jpg/.jpeg files from a target directory.\r\n* Creates copies to a destination directory, leaving original images intact.\r\n* Controllable image compression to further reduce filesize (defaults to 80% of original)\r\n* Detects landscape/portrait images, so if you pass 640x480 as a size, it will figure out the portrait images and resize as 480x640.\r\n* Uses multiple processes to resize images concurrently (very nice if you have loads of photos and an 8-core processor).\r\n* Copies new images while keeping original directory structure.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n1. OSX / Linux\r\n2. Ruby 2.0 or 1.9\r\n3. ImageMagick lib\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nDownload the `batchresize` program to your computer from https://github.com/muxcmux/batchresize\r\n\r\nDownload dependencies with:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install rmagick\r\n    $ gem install xpool\r\n\r\nRun `$ chmod +x batchresize` to make the program executable\r\n\r\nRun `$ ./batchresize --help` to see a list of options\r\n\r\nProfit.\r\n\r\n### LICENSE\r\n\r\nDO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT LICENSE.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
